# Undergraduate-Courses
-Repository of all academic coding assignments during my unergraduate terms at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
-When I was taking these courses, I saved everything on my personal machine and on my Dropbox
-I want to add all of my technical work and projects onto GitHub
-I have spent time either redooing or fixing my old assignments as a way of keeping my skills sharp
-This process does not change documents that were made when taking the course
-In modifications/fixes are made in new subfolders
